# Practical 3 Reflection: File Upload Implementation

## Documentation

### Implemented Features
1. **File Upload System**
   - Multipart form data handling
   - Client-server communication via API route
   - Secure file storage configuration

2. **Validation Layers**
   ```javascript
   // Client-side validation example
   const { register } = useForm({
     rules: {
       file: {
         required: true,
         validate: {
           maxSize: (f) => f.size <= 10 * 1024 * 1024,
           fileType: (f) => 
             ['image/jpeg', 'image/png', 'application/pdf'].includes(f.type)
         }
       }
     }
   });
   ```

3. **User Interface**
- Drag-and-drop zone with preview
- Progress bar with percentage
- Error/success feedback system

### Technical Approach
- Used Next.js API routes for backend logic
- Implemented formidable for server-side parsing
- Created reusable FileDropzone component
- Added custom hooks for upload state management

## Reflection
### Key Learnings
1. File Handling
- Learned multipart/form-data processing
- Implemented proper file storage practices
- Understood MIME type verification

2. Progress Tracking
- Mastered axios interceptors
- Implemented progress event listeners
```javascript
axios.post('/api/upload', formData, {
  onUploadProgress: (progressEvent) => {
    const percent = Math.round(
      (progressEvent.loaded * 100) / progressEvent.total
    );
    setProgress(percent);
  }
});
```

3. Error Handling
- Created comprehensive error states
- Implemented user-friendly messages
- Added validation feedback

### Challenges Faced
#### Challenge 1: File Size Limitations
**Issue:** Server rejecting large files
**Solution:**

Configured Next.js API config:

``` javascript
export const config = {
  api: {
    bodyParser: false
  }
};
```
- Added proper error messaging

#### Challenge 2: Cross-Browser Compatibility
**Issue:** Drag events behaving differently
**Solution:**
- Standardized dropzone implementation
- Added polyfills for older browsers
- Comprehensive testing matrix

#### Challenge 3: Security Concerns
**Issue:** Potential malicious uploads
**Solution:**
- Implemented server-side validation
- Added file type whitelisting
- Sanitized filenames

### Future Improvements
1. Enhanced Features
- File previews before upload
- Multiple file uploads
- Cloud storage integration

2. Security Upgrades
- Virus scanning
- User authentication
- Signed upload URLs

3. Performance
- Chunked uploads
- Compression
- CDN integration

### Conclusion
This project deepened my understanding of file handling in web applications. The experience with client-server file transfer, validation, and progress tracking has prepared me for more complex data processing tasks.
